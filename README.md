Project Overview üè®
The Wild Oasis is an application designed for hotel employees to manage cabins, bookings, and guest information efficiently. The application ensures that only authorized hotel employees can create accounts, upload avatars, and perform various tasks related to cabin and booking management.

Technology Stack ‚öôÔ∏è
The application is built using the following technology stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Routing: React Router
Styling: Styled Components
Remote State Management: React Query
UI State Management: Context API
Form Management: React Hook Form
Other Tools: React Icons, React Hot Toast, Recharts, Date-fns, Supabase, React Error Boundary

Project Requirements üìã
The application caters to the specific needs of hotel employees. Here are some of the key requirements:

‚û°Ô∏èUsers must log in to the application to perform tasks.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èNew users can only be signed up within the application,ensuring only genuine hotel employees have
      accounts.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èUsers can upload avatars, change their names, and passwords.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èDetailed table views for cabins and bookings with relevant information.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èBooking status includes "unconfirmed," "checked in," and "checked out," and should be filterable.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èUsers can create, update, and delete cabins.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èUsers can delete, check in, or check out bookings as guests arrive.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èGuests can add breakfast during check-in.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èGuest data includes full name, email, national ID, nationality, and a country flag.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èA dashboard displaying important information for the last 7, 30, or 90 days.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èStatistics on recent bookings, sales, check-ins, and occupancy rate.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èApplication-wide settings for breakfast price, min and max nights/booking, and max guests/booking.<br/>
      ‚û°Ô∏èDark mode for enhanced user experience.</p>

What I Learned Building The Wild Oasis Project üöÄ

Technical Skills->

1. React.js Mastery: Learned how to architect a React application from scratch, leveraging the power of components, state management, and hooks.

2. Styled Components: Explored the benefits of styling components with Styled Components, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

3. React Router: Implemented navigation with React Router, ensuring a smooth user experience with seamless page transitions.

4. React Query for Remote State Management: Utilized React Query to efficiently manage and synchronize state with the server, optimizing performance.

5. Advanced Context API for UI State Management: Delved into advanced uses of Context API for managing UI state across components, enhancing overall application responsiveness.

6. Form Management with React Hook Form: Mastered form handling with React Hook Form, improving user interactions and data validation.

7. Reusable Components and Logic with Custom Hooks: Explored the creation of custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse components and logic, promoting code reusability.

8. Compound Components and Render Props: Implemented React compound components and utilized render props to create flexible and extensible UI structures.

9. External Libraries Integration: Incorporated various external libraries such as React Icons, React Hot Toast, Recharts, and Date-fns to enhance functionality and user experience.

CRUD Operations and Data Management->

1. Supabase Integration: Integrated Supabase for backend services, gaining hands-on experience in database interactions and CRUD operations.

2. Use of useRef: Employed useRef for efficient handling of references, particularly useful in managing form input focus and data manipulation.
